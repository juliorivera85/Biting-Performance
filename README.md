# Biting-Performance

This is an anaylsis that allows you to compare biting performance capabilities between lizard species. Then you can run some simple paramtric analyses on the morphology of the lizard.

Last, I create models to test which morphological data best preficts biting performance and use AICc to compare models. 

Because this study has not been submitted for publication, I'm not uploading any of the datam, YET. I promist to upload data files once the publication comes out.
